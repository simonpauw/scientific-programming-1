Verifying theoretical hypotheses by hand is often times a time consuming job and a computer lends itself quite well to this purpose. Mathematical intuition required!

But why programming? Check out the video to the side. [Mirjam Leunissen](http://www.dutchdatadesign.nl) creates data visualizations for the [Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/kijkverder/2015/klimaatkennis/) among others. She shares her experiences with programming and creating visualizations.

##### Day 1: getting started

2. Practice thoroughly with the [basic elements](/python/basics) of Python

3. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Use the computer as a [whizkid](/numbers/whizkid)

##### Day 2: prime numbers

1. Lear more about [algorithms](/python/algorithms)

3. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Look for [prime numbers](/numbers/primes)

##### Day 3: results from numbers theory

1. Store data in a [list](/python/lists)

2. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Look for the [longest sequence non-primes](/numbers/sequence)

3. Understand how to write ["good code"](/reference/styleguide) --- and from now on we expect you to implement these guidelines!

4. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Try to (dis)prove [Goldbach's](/numbers/goldbach) conjecture

##### Day 4: graphs

1. Learn how to use [modules](/python/modules) in Python

2. Find out how to [plot](/resources/plot)

3. <span class="badge badge-primary">Assignment</span> Make data intelligible with [graphs](/numbers/graphs)
