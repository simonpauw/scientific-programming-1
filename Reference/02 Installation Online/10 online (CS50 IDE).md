# Programming online

To be able to write your programs online we use an 'integrated development environment' that is hosted on the web, the CS50 IDE. To gain access to this environment you need to complete the following steps. Afterwards you can start programming immediately!

## Creating a CS50 IDE

To gain access to the development environment you can do the following:

1. Register for edX at [https://courses.edx.org/register](https://courses.edx.org/register). You do not need to enroll in a course.

2. Confirm your account via the link in an email they've sent you.

3. Login with your newly acquired account at [https://cs50.io/](https://cs50.io/).

4. They may possible ask you to create a new workspace. Fill in the necessary information:

    - Workspace name: ide50
    - Description: CS50 IDE
    - Template: Harvard's CS50 (*important*)

After creating the workspace you should see this in the screen of your browser:

We call this an integrated development environment, because you can find everything you need to develop programs here: an oversight of your files, a text editor to write code, and a place to execute the programs you've created.

Should you prefer to write your code on a darker screen than the default (like the hackers do ;-)), go to the dropdown menu **view** -> **night mode**. Feel free to snoop around in all the dropdown menus. It's fine if you don't yet know what all the options do or mean.

## Testing

At the top left you see a folder icon with behind it the text **~/workspace**. Right click or ctrl+click it and subsequently select **New Folder**. Call this folder **week1**.

At the bottom of the screen you see the terminal, it's an environment in which you can execute commands. Try and type the following command after the `$`:

    ls

The `ls` command is an abbreviation of the word list. This command shows a list of all files and folders that can be seen from your "current" folder. By default the terminal starts in the folder `~/workspace`, and by executing the command `ls` you should only see the folder `week1` that you've just created. Let's now change the "current folder" by executing the following command:

    cd week1

The command `cd` is an abbreviation of the word compact disc... uh, no... *change directory*. It changes the current folder to another folder, in this case the folder `week1`. If you were to execute `ls` again, there would be no results yet (so you will be shown no visible results). Let's change that fact by running the following command:

    touch hello.py

Now we've created a file called `hello.py` inside of the folder `week1`. To verify that actually happened, you can execute another `ls`. The command `touch` checks whether a file (in this case `hello.py`) already exists, and if not creates that file.

To open the file `hello.py` you have to use your mouse pointer to open the folder icon at the left hand side of the screen. First open the folder `~/workspace`, by clicking the triangle in front of it. Then do the same thing for the folder `week1`, and finally double click the file `hello.py`. Now a new tab has opened up called `hello.py` and this is where we can start programming!

Add the following line of code to the `hello.py` file:

    print("Hello, World!")

Then save your newly written program and ta-da! You've written your first (Python-)program. You can then execute that program using the following command in the terminal:

    python hello.py

If everything is in order you should see directly below that command the words: `Hello, World!`.

## Extra tips

Good to know is that you can also move one folder back up with `cd`:

    cd ..

Here `..` stands for the folder directly 'above' the current one. Want to go back even further up? You can with `../..`. You can also tell `cd` not to move relatively to your current position, but instead move to an 'absolute' path in respect to your login folder:

    cd ~/workspace/week1

That immediately brings you back to the folder `week1` inside of `workspace`.

## Installing Matplotlib and Checkpy

We use a program to check whether your assignments are implemented correctly. We expect you to be very precise when you give the correct output. To do so, we have written a program called `checkpy`, which is not standard in your developing environment. Aside from that we'll get to work with plotting graphs and for that we need a specific module in Python called `matplotlib`. Both of these need to be downloaded additionally.

To download both `matplotlib` and `checkpy` you have to run the following command separately in your terminal:

    pip install matplotlib
    pip install checkpy
    checkpy -d uva/progns

It can take quite a while for each command and a lot of text will move over your screen. In case there is relatively little text on your screen, try to find a message stating something went wrong or ask for assistance! 

To test if everything is in working order and whether `hello.py` is implemented correctly, run the following command in the terminal:

    checkpy hello

Is everything colored green and do you see only happy smileys? That means you've done a-okay, and that you've met our requirements for the assignment! Should there still be some red smileys, no worries! Carefully examine your code and verify it with each of the specifications. And don't forget you can always send us an email if your stuck.
