# Basic Elements

A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specify how a manipulation should occur. Such a manipulation can be mathematical in nature, like solving a set of equations, or finding the roots of a polynomial. But it can also be a symbolic manipulation, such as finding and replacing text in a document.

Though the specifics can differ, there is only a limited number of **instructions** present in each programming language:

information input (input)
: Receiving data from the keyboard, data file or other external source such as the internet.

information output (output)
: Displaying data on the computer screen, writing data to a file or other ways of retaining data.

calculating
: Performing basic mathematical manipulations such as adding or multiplying.

conditional execution
: Verifying whether a condition is dependent on verification to perform specific actions.

repetition
: Repeating a single task or set of tasks multiple times, often times with variation between repetitions.

And believe it or not, but that's about all you'll be needing. Every program you've ever used on the computer, no matter how complicated, at the core consists out of some nature of these action. **Programming** can be seen as repeatedly decomposing a large, complex task in to smaller, easier subtasks, until you can **implement** a program in a programming language, using only the above 5 elements.

Here you'll find some of these elements in the way that you can use them in Python. Using these elements will help you implement the solution for the very first assignment shortly.
